      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        get to know us! &lt;3
        <br />
        Hey! We’re two 20-year-old STEM girls who decided to take a leap this year and bring our creative vision to life through this little shop of ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve always believed that art whether loud, soft, strange, pretty, or anything in between deserves to be seen and worn proudly. So we built this space from scratch for people like us: the dreamers, the moodboard-makers, the ones who crave something a lil different!!
      </p>
      <p>
        From late-night planning and packaging marathons to celebrating every milestone, this journey has been full of heart and though we’re still growing, one thing’s certain that we’re here because we love what we do, and we believe in the magic of **self-expression**!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being here &lt;333 Every share, every order, every message means the world to us. We’re just getting started and we’re so lucky to have you along for the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love,
        <br />

        We’re obsessed with sanrio, kpop, anime, manga, kdramas, manhwa, spicy food, tiramisu, cafes and BRAT —you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live for Charli XCX, grunge pop, vkei, hip hop, hyperpop and the underground scenes that feel like secrets you want to keep but also share with the world.

        We’re broke chronically online baddies that love drama & fun
